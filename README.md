   Imagine a Treasure Chest:

This chest represents the total supply of tokens (totalSupply), which starts at 0 (empty chest).
Each token is like a gold coin inside the chest.
Keeping Track of Ownership:

The contract uses an address book (balances) to keep track of who owns how many coins (tokens).
Each address is like a name tag on a bag, and the number next to it shows how many coins are in that bag.
Creating New Coins (Minting):

The mintToken function acts like adding more coins to the chest.
It takes two arguments:
The address (_address) of the bag where you want to put the new coins.
The number (_value) of new coins to create.
It increases the totalSupply by the number of new coins minted.
It adds the new coins to the bag specified by the address.
Taking Coins Out (Burning):

The burnToken function acts like removing coins from the chest.
It also takes two arguments:
The address (_address) of the bag from which you want to remove coins.
The number (_value) of coins to remove (burn).
It only allows burning if the bag has enough coins (checks balances[_address] >= _value).
If there are enough coins, it reduces the totalSupply by the number burned.
It removes the coins from the specified address's bag.
Key Points:

This is a basic example, and real-world token contracts often have more features.
These functions (mintToken and burnToken) can typically only be called by authorized users (not everyone).
Security is crucial in smart contracts, so real-world code would have additional checks and safeguards.
Additional Notes:

public variables and functions can be accessed by anyone using the contract.
mapping is a data structure that acts like a lookup table, associating addresses with token balances.
uint is a data type for unsigned integers (non-negative whole numbers).
